## Inspiration
Millions of elderly individuals struggle with identifying their medications, understanding side effects, and navigating complex drug interactions. The inspiration for our project stems from team members witnessing grandparents struggling to understand and use smartphone interfaces, often getting lost in complex navigation and small font sizes. To make things easier for this demographic, our team tried tackling this problem with an intuitive AI-powered app that makes medication management effortless.

## What It Does
Users can simply take a photo of their pill, and our app instantly identifies the drug, providing clear and accessible informationâ€”including descriptions, side effects, and potential interactions. We also integrated text-to-speech to read out the medication details, making it easier for users with reading difficulties to access crucial information effortlessly.
